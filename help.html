    <b><u>Ways to Advocate Environmental Sustainability ON YOUR OWN!</b></u><br><br>

    - Recycle, reuse, and recycle. Utilize recycled products (like paper) and use reusable alternatives when possible, such as reusable diapers.
    <br><br>
    - Be conscious of your transportation emissions: carpool, bus, take the train, bike, or walk instead of driving by yourself.
    Additionally, if you can afford to do so, consider investing in an electric or fuel efficient vehicle!
    <br><br>
    - Think about your water and energy consumption: turn the water off when you brush your teeth and take shorter showers.
    Unplug unused appliances and utilize energy efficient appliances. Donate old appliances and electronics. Use a low-flush
    toilet that will reduce water waste. Evaluate the heating, cooling, and insulation of your home to determine if your space is both energy and cost efficient
    <br><br>
    - Consume less meat and dairy. The agriculture industry contributes to deforestation, fossil fuel consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions.
    Producing a single hamburger requires roughly the same amount of water it would take to shower for two months straight. Eat and shop locally
     to reduce your carbon footprint and support your local economy.
    <br><br>
    - Consider investing in solar panels to produce cost-efficient energy. Utilize renewable energy sources.
    <br><br>
    - Use environmentally friendly products (sunscreens, cleaning supplies, etc.). Don&#39t use chemical pesticides that are harmful to the earth.
    <br><br>
    - Eliminate your unnecessary plastic usage (use a reusable water bottle, bring your own bag to the shopping market).
    <br><br>
    - COMPOST!
    <br><br>
    - Plant trees!
    <br><br>
    - Start a discussion and educate your loved ones on environmental issues.
    <br><br>
    - Utilize social media to share your voice.
    <br><br>
    - Support environmental causes and contact your representatives to encourage them to support the planet. Support environmentally friendly legislation and oppose practices that would harm the environment.
    <br><br>
    - Set your yard up with plants and an environment that will attract wildlife and support an ecosystem. Support animal habitats by partaking in activities such as building a bat house or bird feeder. Support conservation efforts.
